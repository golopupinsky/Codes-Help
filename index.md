## Codes

Codes iOS application is designed to help in scanning Barcodes and QR codes of various formats. It also allows to generate QR codes and scan stored images.

### What are these Bar and QR codes?

A barcode is a square or rectangular image consisting of a series of parallel black lines and white spaces of varying widths that can be read by a scanner. Barcodes are applied to products as a means of quick identification. They are used in retail stores as part of the purchase process, in warehouses to track inventory, and on invoices to assist in accounting, among many other uses.

A QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a two-dimensional matrix code capable to encode more information than a regular barcode. QR codes applications include product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.
